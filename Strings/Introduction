Python Strings:
===============

It is a Python Built in character Sequence. used to handle text data.
They are immutable.
In Python, Strings are stored as individual characters in a contiguous memory location.
Both forward as well as backward indexing are provided using Strings in Python.    example-1.py
    Forward indexing starts with 0,1,2,3,....
    Backward indexing starts with -1,-2,-3,-4,....




String Methods:
===============

capitalize()	                It capitalizes the first character of the String.
count(string,begin,end)	        It Counts number of times substring occurs in a String between begin and end index.
endswith(suffix ,begin=0,end=n)	It returns a Boolean value if the string terminates with given suffix between begin and end.
find(substring ,beginIndex, endIndex)	It returns the index value of the string where substring is found between begin index and end index.
index(subsring, beginIndex, endIndex)	It throws an exception if string is not found and works same as find() method.
isalnum()	                    It returns True if characters in the string are alphanumeric i.e., alphabets or numbers and there is at least 1 character. Otherwise it returns False.
isalpha()	                    It returns True when all the characters are alphabets and there is at least one character, otherwise False.
isdigit()	                    It returns True if all the characters are digit and there is at least one character, otherwise False.
islower()	                    It returns True if the characters of a string are in lower case, otherwise False.
isupper()	                    It returns False if characters of a string are in Upper case, otherwise False.
isspace()	                    It returns True if the characters of a string are whitespace, otherwise false.
len(string)	                    It returns the length of a string.
lower()	                        It converts all the characters of a string to Lower case.
upper()	                        It converts all the characters of a string to Upper Case.
startswith(str ,begin=0,end=n)	It returns a Boolean value if the string starts with given str between begin and end.
swapcase()	                    It inverts case of all characters in a string.
lstrip()	                    It removes all leading whitespace of a string and can also be used to remove particular character from leading.
rstrip()	                    It removes all trailing whitespace of a string and can also be used to remove particular character from trailing.
