What is Iterator?
Iterator in Python is simply an object that can be iterated upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.
Python iterator object must implement two special methods, __iter__() and __next__()

list,string and tuples are iterables.


Pseudo Code:

for element in iterable:
    #Do Something with the element


equaivalent to
# create an iterator object from that iterable
iter_obj = iter(iterable)

# infinite loop
while True:
    try:
        # get the next item
        element = next(iter_obj)
        # do something with element
    except StopIteration:
        # if StopIteration is raised, break from loop
        break
