Version Control Systems(VCS):
=============================

There are two types of VCS:
    1. Central VCS
    2. Distributed VCS


1. Central VCS(SVN - Sub version) or Centralised Source Control:
=================================================================
    * There will be one central VCS Server which acts as the central repository.
    * Clinets/Users can check out the file and can modify it and checks in back to the central server.
    * Clents doesn't have full version control over the version database.
    * If somthing happens to central server, clients doen't have full version system.


2. Distributed VCS(GIT):
========================
    * your local repository has all the information which your server repository has.
    * Each acts as a central server even though there is only one source repository.
    * fall back is exists here because all the local copies full version control
    * In other words,Every developer has entire backup of the repository.
