How to Create the Singly Linked List:
--------------------------------------

Creating Classes:
=================

Class Node
===========
Firstly, we must create a node inorder to create a singly linked list. To do this, we create a class Node with data and nextnode attributes.
The default value of nextnode to be None.

we can use getter and setter methods to do this.


Class SingleLinkedList
======================
Now that the Node class is created, it is time to create the LinkedList class.
This has only one attribute HEAD = None by default indicating it is empty.
To keep track of number of nodes in the LinkedList, we can add a size attribute to the LinkedList and default it to 0


Inserting a Node
================

This is the method of the SingleLinked Class.
To make the coding simple and efficient we add the ne node to the beginning of the linkedlist.
In other words, the head will always point to the most recently added node.


example:
========

Let's say we need to add 30 to a linked list. we need to do following steps:

    Step 1 : Create a node object with 7 as the data and the next pointing to HEAD node.
    Step 2 : Point the HEAD Pointer to this new node.

    Finally increment the size by 1.



Remove Node from the LinkedList:
================================
Algorithm:

Step 1 : have two two pointers:
    1.1  curr - Intially to points to head
    1.2  prev - intially points to None

Step 2 : If inputted value matches the data of cur:
    2.1 : Check prev exists
        2.1.1  : If Yes, set next node of prev to next node of curr.
        2.2.2  : If no, simply point the head to next node of curr( this happens when you want to delete the first node)
        2.2.3  : Decrement the size by 1
        2.2.4  : Return True

Step 3 : If inputted value doesn't match the data of cur:
    3.1 : proceed to next node by:
        3.1.1 : point prev to cur
        3.2.2 : pointing cur to next node of cur

Step 4 : Repeat the steps 1-3 till the end of the list
Step 5 : If the end of the linked list is reached, return false indicating no
         elemenent in the linked list matches the inputted value.
