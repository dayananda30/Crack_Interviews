Named Tuples:
=============

    *   Python Supports a type of container like dictionaries called "Named Tuples" present in module "Collection".

    *   Using namedtuple is way shorter than defining a class manually

    *   Like Tuples, NamedTuples are immutable


Why NamedTuple:
===============
    Unlike dictionary , it supports both access from key value and iteration,
    the functionality that dictionaries lack.



Access Operations
==================
    1.  Access by index : The attribute values of namedtuple() are ordered
        and can be accessed using the index number unlike dictionaries which are not accessible by index.

    2.  Access by keyname : Access by keyname is also allowed as in dictionaries.

    3.  Using getattr() :- This is yet another way to access the value by giving namedtuple
        and key value as its argument.

    4.  _fields :- This function is used to return all the keynames of the namespace declared.

    5.  _replace() :- This function is used to change the values mapped with the passed keyname.
