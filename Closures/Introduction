Closures:
---------
    Functions which are defined inside another function are called nested functions. Nested functions can access
    variables inside the enclosure scope.


    Closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes eventhough they are not in the memory.



When and Why to Closures:
-------------------------
    1.  As Closures are used as a call back functions, they provide some sort of data hiding. This helps us to reduce
        the use of global variables.
