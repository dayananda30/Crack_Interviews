MultiProcessing:
================
    * Heavy weight
    * It has its own dedicated address space, stack and heap memory.
    * Two processes can talk to each other via IPC calls such file, shared memory and PIPE.
    * Any memory leak in one process will not effect other process since they are isolates from one another.



MultiThreading:
===============
    * Light weight
    * Address space is shared by all the threads inside a process.
    * Each thread has its own stack (different instructions needs to be executed.)
    * But all the threads will have same heap memory (global varibales.)
