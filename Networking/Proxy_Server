What is a proxy server?
========================

Proxy servers protects our identity from the other party.

example:

Me  <------>  Friend  <-------> Crush
              (acts as
              a proxy to check
              whehter she likes
              me or not)



Roles of Proxy Servers:
=======================

* Obscure client IP
* Block malicious traffic
* Block sites
* Log activity
* Improve performance




Workplace clients   < ------------- > Proxy Server < -------------- > Internet
(10.9.8.0/private n/w)          10.9.8.254      107.20.140.96


1. Obscure client IP:
====================
    * The primary advantage of private network is , they are not routable over the internet.
    * Proxy server converts private IP into Pubic IP address.
        ex : here 10.9.8.254 private is converted to 107.20.140.96 pubic IP address whicg is routable over the internet.
    * Proxy sends the request on our behalf.
    * proxy abstracts the identity ofthe client IP.


2. Block Sites:
===============
    * Add firewall rules at the proxy server.
    * To block some sites.


3. Log activity:
=================
    * how many sites/how much time spent in particular sites.

4. Improve performance:
=======================
    * proxy caches the data
    * If same data is requested by other client ip, cache will serve the data.
