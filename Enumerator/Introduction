What is Enumerate?
The enumerate() method adds counter to an iterable and returns it (the enumerate object).


Syntax:
enumerate(iterable, start=0)

Parameters:
    iterable - a sequence, an iterator, or objects that supports iteration
    start (optional) - enumerate() starts counting from this number. If start is omitted, 0 is taken as start.
