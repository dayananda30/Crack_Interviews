"""
The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state
to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after
the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once
and sending them back like a list.
